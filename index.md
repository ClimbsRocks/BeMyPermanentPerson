Hopefully you don't need to look up the ending online to see where this plotline is going...

This part of the journey either exists because:
- You're a hacker, and most hackers seem to enjoy the pursuit every bit as much as the loot.
- Sometimes in relationships, you just gotta try a bunch of things and see what sticks.
- If you pay really close attention to the system, there's ususally an easier path through.
- There are approximately 232,000,000 humans in the world who speak English and are within a relevant age bracket. Of those, there's exactly one obviously correct answer for who to partner with.
- I'm curious to see if you can parallelize this on the GPUs.

Take the National Parks, in the order given by the clues in the first section.

Take the first letter of each (with one exception, which you probably noticed already)

Apply the code below to each letter. Yes, I'm being intentionally opaque about how to interpret the code. It should yield one obviously correct answer once you've figured it out.

## Code
[[-25, -15, -10, -6, -2, 3, 17, 20, 24], [-18, -17, -15, -9, -5, -4, 6, 9], [-24, -22, -13, -10, 0, 15, 18, 19], [-25, -18, -16, -11, -10, 0, 2, 3], [-24, -19, -13, -9, 0, 6, 8, 19], [-20, -17, -16, -10, -1, 0, 15, 21], [-17, -14, -8, -6, -1, 0, 23, 25], [-14, -8, -7, -6, -5, -3, 0, 17], [-18, -10, -4, -1, 1, 19, 25], [0], [-18, -16, -12, -8, 1], [-12, -11, 2, 9, 22], [-25, -22, -2, -1, 14], [-24, -22, -14, 8, 16], [-22, -20, -7, 19, 20], [-17, 15, 20, 22, 25], [2, 4, 9, 16, 22], [-20, -11, -10, -3, 9], [-22, -16, 15, 26], [-8, -1, 3, 11], [-12, 5, 8, 11], [-23, -10, -8, 6]]
